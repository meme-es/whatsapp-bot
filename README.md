## Trying the chatbot

**This is a guide about how to use the bot**

### Prerequisites

You have to have the WhatsApp application installed on your phone.

### Usage

If you want to try the bot, follow the next steps:

- Add the next number to your contacts: +1 415 523 8886.
- Open WhatsApp.
- Send "join zoo-rubbed" without quotes to start the communication.
- Say "Hello!" and start to interact with the bot.

The chat just knows about cats and dogs, try to speak about something else and see what will happen.

Reply "stop" without quotes at any time when you want to stop interacting with the chatbot.

## How It Works

This project was built using three components:

* This web project using Sinatra. [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby.
* [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/), an API that allows the web application to communicate with WhatsApp
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Here is where I published this web application.

For Twilio and Heroku you must create an account for each to let manage your sandbox in Twilio and your projects in Heroku.
